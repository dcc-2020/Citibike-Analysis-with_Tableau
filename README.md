### Citibike User Data and Trend
In the graph of 2020 monthly usage, we can see there is a decline in the usage of bikes during winter. This is likely due to the weather condition not appealing people to be riding bikes. When the weather starts to get warmer, the number of bike usage starts to pick up which will form a bell shape with the peak point during summer. However, keep in mind that this data is from 2020 where COVID-19 started. The pandemic made this year's data slightly different with the lowest bike usage being in April. The 2020 monthly usage graph is further broken down to see the usage by different user type and the duration it is used for. The Citi bike usage and duration by subscriber is relatively consistent compare to short-term customers. Short-term customers have a very low usage rate during the winter and starts to increase when it gets close to the middle of the year. A phenomenon that can be notice here is the duration short-term customers use a bike is alot higher than subscribers. A potential reason is the subscribers who uses Citi bikes use it as a way to commute so their trip is just to go from point A to B whereas the short-term customers use Citi bike maybe for sight seeing or just a relax day with friends. Naturally this made the usage duration of short-term customers to be longer. On the next page is a stacked bar graph of different user type in every months. In this graph, we can see the major cause to the shift in usage number to be mostly due to short-term customers. There is still some usage difference by subsciber throughout the months but it is not a big difference.
